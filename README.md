This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in Java. The game is built using Java Swing for the GUI.


## Game Features

- The game starts with a small snake that grows as it eats apples.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the borders of the game panel.
- The game keeps track of the score which is the number of apples eaten.
- The game can be restarted by pressing the 'Space bar' key after the game ends.
- The game also keeps track of the high score across all games and saves it to a high score file so that it can be 
accessed even after the game is closed.
- The game can be paused and resumed by pressing the 'P' key.
- The game can be exited by pressing the 'Esc' key.
- The game speed can be controlled by pressing the 'd' key to increase the speed and the 's' key to decrease the speed.

## How to Run the Game
